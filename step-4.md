- You prepared your personal webpage on CodePen.
- Your webpage meets all the criteria
  - Contains \> 100 words, 3 images (one of which is centered), a list
  - CSS code written inside the CSS tab
  - Free of syntax errors

### Acceptable 

### Common Rejected Reasons

#### 1. Image not displayable
#### 2. Code contains syntax error when checked using HTML Analyzer and CSS Analyzer on CodePen
#### 3. No image is centered

##### General Feedback (Delete the reasons that do not apply)
> - Some of the images cannot be displayed properly. You may want to check each image URL to ensure it points to a **publicly** accessible **image** (and not a webpage).
> - There are errors in your HTML and CSS code. You can use CodePen's "HTML Analyzer" and "CSS Analyzer" to check for issues.
> - The requirement that "one of the images must be centered horizontally on the page" has not yet been met.
>
> Can you address these issues and resubmit your CodePen link?
>
> If you need help fixing your code, you can share your **CodePen link** to an AI tool and ask it the relevant questions.
