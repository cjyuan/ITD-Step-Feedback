### Acceptables
- Trinees submitted a link to an MS Excel file on Office 365
- The format is a bit off (Note: use your discretion)

### Common Rejected Reasons

#### 1. Access Denined
##### Feedback
> Can you grant public "Viewer" permission to the Google sheet and resubmit the link. Otherwise we cannot view its content.

#### 2. Data not ordered by dates in ascending order
##### Feedback
The data should be ordered by dates in ascending order.

#### 3. No filtered result
##### Feedback
> Your Google Sheet does not show the filtered results. (Item 9 in the instructions)  
> It's possible that you used temporary filters instead of permanent filters.  
> If that’s the case, you may want to **look up how to apply filters in Google Sheets** so the filtered view can be shared with other users.

#### 4. Filters not applied to all columns (only applied to Date and Point of Sales columns)
##### Feedback
> If filters are applied only to the "Date" and "Point of Sale" columns, reordering will affect only those two columns,
> while the corresponding data in the other columns will remain unchanged and misaligned.
>
> However, if filters are applied to all relevant columns, then reordering ensures that the data across all columns remains properly aligned.

#### 5. Incorrect filter settings
##### Feedback
> The filtering condition on the **Date** column was not set up correctly.
> 
> To select dates that fall between **1 June 2024 and 31 Dec 2024**,
> consider filter the dates **by condition** and use the condition
> **is between** to specify dates between 1 June 2024 and 31 Dec 2024.

---
> The filtering and ordering requirements listed in item 9 of the instructions were not implemented properly.
> Can you set up the filters so that your sheet shows only 12 rows of data, similar to those in the sample output?

#### 6. Filters not applied to the row with the column headers
##### Feedback
> Filters should be applied to the row with the column headers.
> Because you applied the filters to the row above the headers, the headers were also filtered out.

#### 7. Did not include their name in the Google Sheet title
##### Feedback
> You missed this acceptance criteria:
> - You have added your name to the Google Sheet’s file name (title).
