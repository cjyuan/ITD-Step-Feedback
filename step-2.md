##### Feedback to be given when the answer to question 3 is not quite correct
> For questions 3, actions that are not quite appropriate include:
>
> 2\. Giving an AI tool their assigned problems and ask it to solve them for them. They then copy and paste the output, making no edits.  
> 4\. Attempting to solve the problems, then giving up asking an AI tool to fix their code. Then copying and pasting the answer without understanding the changes it made.  
> 6\. Copying another student’s answers.  
> 7\. Sending a direct message to a active volunteer  
> 8\. Giving an AI tool their assigned problems and ask it to solve them for them. They then copy and paste the output, making small edits.  
>
> When we ask AI for a solution or copy a solution from others, we often skip thinking and problem-solving, which are the most important parts of understanding.
> Instead of asking AI to present the **solution** directly, we can ask it to give **hints**, **directions**, or **examples** that could help us figure out the solution.
>
> Why copy/paste code is not encouraged:
> - When we type the code by ourselves, we remember it better. Our hands and mind work together, so learning is stronger.
> - Writing the code helps us notice small details, like commas, brackets, or logic mistakes. Copying skips this practice.
>
> Why sending a direct message to a volunteer might not be appropriate:
> - Volunteers give their time freely, so it's better to ask questions in public channels where everyone can see and help.
>   This way, the volunteer's time is respected, and other people can also learn from the answer.
