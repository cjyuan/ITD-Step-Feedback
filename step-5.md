#### 2. The deployed the "wrong" page
Possible reasons: 
- They uploaded the `dist` folder (instead of the files inside)
- They uploaded the ZIP file instead of the files extracted from it.
- They did not name their HTML file `index.html`.

##### Feedback
> GitHub Pages requires your website files to be located in the repositoryâ€™s **root** (**top-level**) folder.
>
> To deploy your site, move the contents of the dist folder into the root folder of your repository.
>
> If an `index.html` file is not present in the root folder, GitHub Pages will instead display the `README.md` file by default.
